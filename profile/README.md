[KCL](https://github.com/kcl-lang/kcl) is a constraint-based record & functional language mainly used in configuration and policy scenarios.

## What is it for?

+ Generate low-level static configuration data like JSON, YAML, etc.
+ Reduce boilerplate in configuration data with the schema modeling.
+ Define transformers and constraints for configuration data and templates and mutate/validate them automatically.
+ Organize, simplify, unify, and manage large configurations scalably without side effects.
+ Used as a platform engineering language to deliver modern apps with [KusionStack](https://github.com/KusionStack).
